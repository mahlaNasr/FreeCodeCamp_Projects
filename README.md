<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Projects

This repository is for showcasing all the projects that I have done by completing some of the freeCodeCamp coding courses. My aim is to gain experience in both front and back ends in order to become a full stack developer in the end!

I have listed the courses that have been completed so far which had multiple big projects towards the end in order to test my knowledge.

There are two folders so far in this repository:
* [[completed](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc30cc2cbc-3d66-4eae-8983-d9e46ec37056/responsive-web-design)] Legacy Responsive Web Design Projects 
* [ongoing] Front End Dev Libraries Projects 


<!-- 
This project proposes a system where humanoid robot, NAO, uses scanned QR code ticket information to form simple conversations with the visitors at the [**the National Portrait Gallery**](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/national-gallery-x) art museum. -->




<!-- Legacy Responsive Web Design Projects -->
## Legacy Responsive Web Design Projects 

In this course, I went over the knowledge of the web technologies first to see if I know everything at the basic level. Once I revised everything, I went to complete the 5 end challenges that are listed below.

This project contained the languages that are used to build webpages: 
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) - for content
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - for design

A summary of the skills that were taught in this course:
* Basic HTML and HTML5
* Basic CSS
* Applied Visual Design
* Applied Accessibility
* Responsive Web Design Principles
* CSS Flexbox 
* CSS Grid
* and Responsive Web Design Projects
