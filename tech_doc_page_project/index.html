      <p>Python is a computer programming language. Or, in other words, a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing
      a computer to perform tasks. Its original creator, Guido van Rossum, named it after the BBC television show &apos;Monty
      Python&apos;s Flying Circus.&apos; Hence, you&apos;ll find that Python books, code examples, and documentation sometimes contain
      references to this television show.</p>
      
      <p>People use Python in many places. Its rich base library makes it excellent for all kinds of little helper scripts. But
      it scales just as well to large systems. To illustrate: the original creators of YouTube used Python for the most part!
      Dropbox, as far as I know, is primarily written in Python as well. And did you know Instagram&apos;s entire backend and
      website are written in Python as well?<br>
      You can use Python to automate tasks, perform calculations, create user interfaces, create website backends, access
      databases, download information from the Internet, etc. It&apos;s a versatile language that is easy to learn and write, and
      although perfect for beginning programmers, is just as useful and powerful for seasoned professionals.</p>
      
      <p>Python is extremely popular in a quickly growing field of expertise called data science. Many data scientists use Python
      for their day-to-day work. And these are just a few examples. If you start looking closely, Python is very ubiquitous.
      <br>
      Many people say that Python comes with batteries included. It&apos;s a fun way of stating that it includes a comprehensive
      base library. In addition to this, you can find hundreds of thousands of external packages contributed by the enormous
      community. You&apos;ll find supporting base libraries and packages for pretty much anything you want to accomplish.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Python_History">
      <header>Python History</header>
      <p>It all started on a cold, foggy night in December 1987, when a Dutch scientist called Guido van Rossum woke up in the
      middle of the night. He just had a profound dream, and although he didn&apos;t know it at the time, that dream would
      eventually change his life and the lives of many others.So he got out of bed and slipped into his pantofles. After throwing some wood in the almost smothered fireplace, he
      started jotting down as much of this dream as he could remember. A new programing language was born: Python.</p>
    
      <p>The only truth from the above story is the name Guido van Rossum and the date. In 1987, Guido worked on a big
      distributed operating system at the CWI, a national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the
      Netherlands. Within that project, he had some freedom to work on side projects. Armed with the knowledge and experience
      he had built up in the years before, working on a computer language called ABC, he started writing the Python
      programming language.</p>
      
      <p>As you can see from the Python history timeline, Python 2 and 3 have been developed and maintained side by side for an
      extended period. The primary reason is that Python 3 code is not entirely backward compatible with Python 2 code. This
      incompatibility caused a prolonged adoption rate. Many people were happy with version 2 and didn&apos;t see much reason to
      upgrade. On top of that, Python 3 was initially slower than Python 2. As Python 3 kept improving and receiving new
      features, eventually, it started to take off.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>To get started with writing Pythton, open the Terminal and type python3. Then write your first "Hello world" Python code:</p>
      <code>
        >>> print("Hello World") <br>
        Hello World
      </code>
      <p>Press enter and you&apos;ll see an output saying Hello World.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>A variable is used to store information that can be referenced later on.</p>
      <p>So a variable is what we use to name the result of, for example, a calculation we make. Or, in other words, we can
      assign the result of that calculation to a variable. We can create an unlimited amount of variables; we just have to
      make sure we give them unique names.</p>
      <p>Some characters are not allowed in a variable name; there are a few rules we need to abide by. Let&apos;s start with the
      complete list of valid characters that can appear in a variable name:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lowercase and uppercase letters: a-z and A-Z</li>
        <li>Numbers: 0-9</li>
        <li>Underscores: _</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, there are these two rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character, and can not start with a number.</li>
        <li>Names are case-sensitive</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <p>Now let&apos;s declare a variable name called result:</p>
      <code>
        >>> result = 3 * 5 <br>
        >>> result
      </code>
      <p>Python sees an assignment: we assign the result of 3 * 5 to the variable called result. Assignments are done
      with the &apos;=&apos; character, which is conveniently called &apos;is&apos;. So we just told Python: I declare that result 
      is the result of the expression 3 * 5.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
      <header>Strings</header>
      <p>A string in Python is a sequence of characters. In even simpler terms, a string is a piece of text. Strings are not just a Python thing. Itâ€™s a well-known term in the
      field of computer science and means the same thing in most other languages as well. Now that we know what a string is,
      we&apos;ll look at how to create a string. A Python string needs quotes around it for it to be recognized as such, like this:</p>
      <code>
            >>> 'Hello, World'
          </code>
      <p>Because of the quotes, Python understands this is a sequence of characters and not a command, number, or variable.
      And just like with numbers, some of the operators we learned before work on Python strings too. Try it with the
      following expressions:</p>
      <code>
        >>> 'a' + 'b' <br>
        'ab' <br>
        >>> 'ab' * 4 <br>
        'abababab'
      </code>
